# Angry Apothecary (WIP)

This project was supposed to be made for a Game Jam by Pirate Software in Summer of '24, but ended up leaving that realm as the team had no prior experience and worked way too big.

Angry Apothecary is a 2D adventure demo that allows you to forage resources, craft potions, and fight the enemies in your path. The game is playable at https://chase-crawford07.itch.io/angry-apothecary!
